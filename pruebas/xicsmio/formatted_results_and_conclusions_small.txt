Statistical Analysis Results and Conclusions:

1. Descriptive Statistics:
The descriptive statistics provide a summary of the central tendency and variability of the runtime data. 
From the results, the mean runtime decreases as we increase the number of threads from 1 to 4. However, 
from 4 threads onwards, the mean runtime shows minor increases.

| Threads | Mean Runtime (ms) | Standard Deviation (ms) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1       | 276,884.25        | 10,713.04               |
| 2       | 187,598.50        | 7,123.41                |
| 3       | 162,041.70        | 7,140.22                |
| 4       | 152,524.20        | 7,449.71                |
| 5       | 154,213.60        | 7,525.07                |
| 6       | 157,687.50        | 6,081.42                |
| 7       | 159,429.15        | 8,076.55                |
| 8       | 160,484.55        | 5,895.92                |

2. Repeated Measures ANOVA on Runtimes:
The repeated measures ANOVA tests if there are statistically significant differences in the means of the 
same subjects under different conditions (in this case, runtime under different thread counts). The results 
show that there's a statistically significant difference in runtimes across different thread counts.

(F Value: 1141.4993, p-value: <0.0001)

3. Tukey's HSD Post-hoc Test on Runtimes:
Following a significant ANOVA result, the Tukey's HSD post-hoc test helps identify which specific group(s) 
differ from each other. 
Tukey's HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) post-hoc test is a multiple comparison test used to find 
which means among a set of means differ from the rest. It is commonly used after a significant ANOVA result 
to determine which groups are different. The test compares all possible pairs of means and controls the 
familywise error rate.

The other pairwise comparisons did not show a statistically significant difference in runtimes.


4. Effect Sizes (Cohen's d compared to 1 thread):
Effect size is a measure of the magnitude of the difference between groups. Here, Cohen's d is calculated 
to quantify the difference in runtimes between 1 thread and the other thread counts.

| Threads | Cohen's d |
|---------|-----------|
| 2       | 9.81      |
| 3       | 12.62     |
| 4       | 13.48     |
| 5       | 13.25     |
| 6       | 13.68     |
| 7       | 12.38     |
| 8       | 13.46     |

5. Paired t-tests between adjacent thread counts:
The paired t-tests are used to compare the means of the same group at two different times (in this case, 
runtimes between adjacent thread counts). The results provide insights into the significance of the performance 
differences between consecutive thread counts.

| Thread Pair | t-statistic | p-value   |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 vs 2     | 41.00       | <0.0001   |
| 2 vs 3     | 16.97       | <0.0001   |
| 3 vs 4     | 5.69        | 0.00002   |
| 4 vs 5     | -0.84       | 0.414     |
| 5 vs 6     | -2.51       | 0.021     |
| 6 vs 7     | -0.93       | 0.366     |
| 7 vs 8     | -0.66       | 0.516     |

6. One-way ANOVA on Objective Values:
The one-way ANOVA tests if there's a statistically significant difference in the means of objective values 
across different thread counts. The results show that there's no significant impact of thread counts on the 
objective values.

(F Statistic: 0.0862, p-value: 0.9989)

Conclusions:

- Increasing the number of threads generally improves performance, with the most substantial gains observed 
  when moving from 1 to 4 threads.
- The optimal number of threads for minimizing runtime, based on this dataset, appears to be around 3 or 4.
- Performance plateaus or shows minor reductions after 4 threads.
- Increasing the number of threads does not have a significant impact on the objective value, as evidenced by 
  the ANOVA on objective values.
