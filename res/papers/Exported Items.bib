These features include the different metaheuristic techniques covered, mechanisms for solution encoding, constraint handling, neighborhood speciﬁcation, hybridization, parallel and distributed computation, software engineering best practices, documentation and user interface, etc. A metric has been deﬁned for each feature so that the scores obtained by a framework are averaged within each group of features, leading to a ﬁnal average score for each framework. Out of 33 frameworks ten have been selected from the literature using well-deﬁned ﬁltering criteria, and the results of the comparison are analyzed with the aim of identifying improvement areas and gaps in speciﬁc frameworks and the whole set. Generally speaking, a signiﬁcant lack of support has been found for hyper-heuristics, and parallel and distributed computing capabilities. It is also desirable to have a wider implementation of some Software Engineering best practices. Finally, a wider support for some metaheuristics and hybridization capabilities is needed.},

A territory design that balances the risk of branches is important for the proﬁtability and long-term sustainability of a MFI. In order to address such particular business needs, this paper proposes a novel risk-balanced territory planning model for a MFI. The proposed mixed integer programming model lets the MFI choose the location of the branches to be designated as territory centers and allocate the customers to these centers with respect to planning criteria such as the total workload, monetary amount of loans and proﬁt allocation while balancing the territory risk. This model is solved using a branch and cut based hybrid-heuristic framework. We discuss the impact of the risk balancing and merits of the proposed model.},

	abstract = {The vertex p-center problem consists of locating p facilities among a set of M potential sites such that the maximum distance from any demand to its closest located facility is minimized. The complete vertex p-center problem solves the p-center problem for all p from 1 to the total number of sites, resulting in a multi-objective tradeoff curve between the number of facilities and the service distance required to achieve full coverage. This trade-off provides a reference to planners and decision-makers, enabling them to easily visualize the consequences of choosing different coverage design criteria for the given spatial configuration of the problem. We present two fast algorithms for solving the complete p-center problem, one using the classical formulation but trimming variables while still maintaining optimality, the other converting the problem to a location set covering problem and solving for all distances in the distance matrix. We also discuss scenarios where it makes sense to solve the problem via brute-force enumeration. All methods result in significant speed-ups, with the set covering method reducing computation times by many orders of magnitude.},

Results Empirical evidence over a widely used set of benchmark instances on location literature, reveals the positive impact of each of the developed components and the quality of the solutions delivered by the heuristic when compared with existing methods. For instance, the proposed heuristic was able to find feasible solutions to all but two instances, while the best of the existing methods failed in 18 of these instances.
Conclusion It is found empirically that the proposed heuristic outperforms the best existing heuristic for this problem in terms of solution quality, running time, and reliability on finding feasible solutions for hard instances.},

	abstract = {Embotelladoras ARCA is a Mexican company dedicated to the production, distribution, and sales of soft drink brands owned by the Coca-Cola Company, ARCA, and third parties. One of the most relevant problems the company faces is how to segment its customers into territories to accommodate the most efficient handling of marketing and distribution decisions. This territory design must also satisfy several planning requirements, such as territory compactness, connectivity, and balancing, and similarity with the existing design. Before 2009, the company planners defined these units based on their experiences, without using quantitative tools, giving more weight to the territory compactness criterion. This method of definition led to a number of undesirable issues, including highly unbalanced territories; that is, the final plans had large disparities in size with respect to both number of customers and total product demand. In this paper, we apply operations research methods to determine configurations of the territorial units that ensure territory balance with respect to both number of customers and total product demand, while complying with other important planning requirements and maximizing territory compactness. Using this methodology has resulted in significant enhancements with respect to the territory imbalance issue while maintaining the level of territory compactness. We also highlight additional benefits of this approach. Embotelladoras ARCA has adopted this proposed tool to make its design decisions.},

	abstract = {In this work a problem motivated by a real-world case from a beverage distribution ﬁrm in Mexico is addressed. Diﬀerent planning criteria are taken into account in order to create acceptable territory designs. Namely, each territory needs to be compact, connected and balanced according to two attributes (number of costumers and product demand). Two GRASP based heuristics (BGRASP and TGRASP) are proposed for this NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. For each of them two variants are studied: i) keeping connectivity as a hard constraint during construction and post-processing phases and, ii) ignoring connectivity during the construction phase and adding this as a minimizing objective function during the post-processing phase . The main diﬀerence between BGRASP and TGRASP is the way they consider the planning criteria during the construction phase. In BGRASP, the construction attempts to ﬁnd high quality solutions based on the optimization of two criteria: compactness and balancing according to the number of customers, that is, demand is treated as a constraint. The construction phase in TGRASP considers three objectives to be optimized: compactness and balancing with respect to the two attributes (number of customers and demand). That is, the demand balancing constraints are relaxed and treated as part of the objective function. The proposed procedures are evaluated on a variety of problem instances, with 500 and 1000 basic units. We carried out an analysis of these procedures using diﬀerent performance measures such as number of non-dominated points, k-distance, size of the space cover (SSC), coverage of two sets measure, and time. We observed that, SSC, coverage of two sets measure and time, present signiﬁcant variation depending on the GRASP procedure used. The number of points and k-distance measures did not present signiﬁcant variation over all evaluated procedures. BGRASP-I provides good frontiers in shortest time and BGRASP-II has the best coverage of the eﬃcient points given by the others procedures.},

El problema se plantea como una cuestión de optimización biobjetivo, donde se desea optimizar simultáneamente dos medidas de desempeño: la dispersión territorial y el desbalance territorial respecto a la demanda del producto. El problema está también sujeto a restricciones de balance con respecto al número de clientes y conectividad territorial. Para resolver este complejo problema se ha desarrollado e implementado una metaheurística multiobjetivo basada en búsqueda dispersa. Se presenta una evaluación computacional donde se demuestra el excelente desempeño del método propuesto, superando incluso a los mejores dos métodos conocidos a nivel mundial para problemas de optimización multiobjetivo (NSGA-II y SSPMO).},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a reactive GRASP approach to a commercial territory design problem motivated by a real-world application in a beverage distribution ﬁrm. The mathematical framework includes, as planning criteria, minimizing a measure of territory dispersion, balancing the different node activity measures among territories and territory contiguity. The proposed GRASP approach incorporates several features such as reactivity, by allowing self-adjustment of the restricted candidate list quality parameter, and ﬁltering, which avoids executing the local search phase in unpromising bad solutions generated by the construction phase. The algorithm has been tested in several data sets. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. It was observed that the reactivity and the ﬁltering proved very useful in terms of feasibility with respect to the balancing constraints, and ﬁnd more robust solutions when tested over the basic GRASP. The local search scheme proved to be very effective as well. Moreover, the proposed approach obtained solutions of much better quality (in terms of both its dispersion measure and its feasibility with respect to the balancing constraints) than those found by the ﬁrm method in relatively fast computation times.},
